			1) First, determine enemy party size
			2) Using that, assume that each 'round', every character is going to get 1 hit off (don't worry about order for now)
			3) So, we want that - on average - both parties will deal about the same % of damage to each other in a given round
			4) ... We actually want the player damage to be a liiiiittle higher (and we're ignoring the player ability to heal)
			5) So, from there, we can fix down stats for the first monster
			6) But how? Just... picking stats and fixing them seems like a good first step, I think
			7) WELL OKAY LOOKS LIKE I FOUND A SOLUTION :D
