First, we build the enemy generator
We test things as are.

Then we refactor - need to decouple the Character class from the BattleEngine (instead, make the character for the engine, then add the character 
into the engine) At this stage, we need to give Micah the magic_attack and heal skills

Skills also need an MP cost

After that, we can move back to the UI. (Add in a 'menu' screen; make a UI using clickable sprites for the battle scene itself)

From there, we refactor yet again, and push the initial commit to github.

With any luck, this can all happen on Saturday.

////REFACTOR IN PROGRESS////
BattleEngine.js
UserData.js (needs default combat settings)
MainMenuScreen.js (need to be able to pick functions)
character.js (Needs implementation)
